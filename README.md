# New-Coders-Survey-Data-Visualizations

Our project uses [survey data](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey) from FreeCodeCamp (with over 15,000 participants). We plan to visualize different aspects of the data provided by people who are just starting out in the software development field. This project stems from the fact that we are all from different backgrounds with little experience in coding. Our intentions are to help communicate this information to people who are interested in software development but have preconceived notions about the requirements needed to pursue a career in this field. Our rich and interactive visualizations will help people who may be apprehensive of beginning a career in programming. Being able to see how diverse this growing workforce is, and the fact that not everyone needs a degree in Computer Science, may help people build the confidence to learn how to write code. We also show how this is a big career change for a lot of people due to the lucrative job market in this industry. Coders now come in all shapes and sizes, this data helps us show that there are no constraints besides each individualâ€™s commitment to learning.

Our tech stack includes [D3](https://d3js.org/), [Angular 1.5](https://angularjs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/).
